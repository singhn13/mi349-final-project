      <ul>
        <li>Led a full-stack multilingual captioning project, reducing localization time by over 200% with batch translation and SRT (plain-text file for subtitles) export, enabling captioning in multiple languages within seconds. Addressed a critical need for 5+ international clients and earned a performance bonus for outstanding contributions.</li>
        <li>Accelerated translation speeds by 85% by parallelizing OpenAI API calls and fully resolving a critical translation bug through dynamic input segmentation, reducing incomplete translation errors by 100%.</li>
        <li>Developed and maintained NLP features, including context analysis and language recognition using TypeScript and React in an Electron application. Leveraged Azure DevOps to set up automated pipelines for continuous integration and delivery, following Agile methodologies and test-driven development to ensure high-quality, rapid releases.</li>
